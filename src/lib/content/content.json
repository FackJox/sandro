I stood on the highest peak in Afghanistan, Mt Noshaq as the first Afghan woman summited and the highest peak in Pakistan, K2 as the first Pakistani woman summited. I filmed Nirmal Purja as he set a blazing speed record on the 14 8,000ers and filmed Kristin Harila as she smashed it."

Wanting to see more of the world I joined the British army reserve and soon the commando training combined with my passion for story telling provided opportunities to do just that. I filmed army expeds to Dhaulagiri in 2016 and Everest in 2017, began building a basecamp network and haven't really stopped carrying cameras up mountains since."
